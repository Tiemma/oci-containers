# Containers


This repo is here to feature content on containers, pertaining to container runtimes, the OCI specification and how this interaction is set across various environments.


There would also be code samples on interacting with containers from a code level with the aid of 
- syscalls
- cgroups
- capabilities
- generic binary configurations


## How to start

You can bring up the environment and ssh into the machine by performing


```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

All the necessary tooling to get started have been specified in the [install-deps.sh](install-deps.sh) file in this repo.
