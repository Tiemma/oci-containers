# Containers

This repo illustrates the various linux-based internal workings of containers and how they function.

## Setup
To setup this project, kindly run the vagrant file to get access to the ubuntu environment used in testing the configurations here

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

```

This setup would clone the repo into the `oci-containers` folder and allow you test all the code samples.
